<h1 title="">FLORIDA CAVERNS
<br /><span class="small">A NATURE-MADE WONDERLAND</span></h1>
<p class="center"><i>By</i> <span class="sc">Robert O. Vernon</span>
<br /><i>Assistant Director, Florida Geological Survey</i></p>
<p>Florida is truly a child of the sea, since all
the rocks composing its land were formed
directly on the ocean bottoms or by streams
emptying along the shores. From the record
of these rocks we know that Florida has been alternately
above and below the sea many times in the geologic past.
In fact, the rocks visible in the park area at Florida Caverns,
near Marianna, Florida, and in the caves were formed from
the hard shells of animals that lived in one of these seas.
As the animals died, their shells accumulated on the sea
bottoms, where they were covered by other shells and
hardened into lime rock.</p>
<p>These shells, called &ldquo;fossils&rdquo; by the geologist, are remains
representing cemeteries of the past. Along most of our
coastal areas and sea bottoms these shells are accumulating
and forming limestone today. Such limestone has formed
also in the areas many miles removed from the present
seas, as in Iowa and other middle western states, telling
us where seas have been in the past.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig4">
<img src="images/p03.jpg" alt="As visitors explore the well-lighted trails and passageways, they notice the icicle-like formations that hang from the ceilings and the heavier ones that project from the floor. They study the columns that seem to help support the rock above and the small passages that extend in many directions. They notice sea shells imbedded in walls and ceilings." width="500" height="338" />
<p class="bq">As visitors explore the well-lighted trails and passageways, they notice the icicle-like formations that hang from the ceilings and the heavier ones that project from the floor. They study the columns that seem to help support the rock above and the small passages that extend in many directions. They notice sea shells imbedded in walls and ceilings.</p>
</div>
<p>How do we know that these limestones were formed
in the sea? The next time you go through the caves at
Florida Caverns look closely at the walls and you will be
able to find the shells of <i>Scollops</i> and other clams. These
animals lived only in shallow seas. The most common shell
that you will notice will be many small coiled flat shells
about the size of barley seed and flat thin disks about the
size of dimes and quarters. The animals that formed these
shells are known as <i>Foraminifera</i> and have the fancy names
of <i>Operculinoides</i> and <i>Lepidocyclina</i>. They are one celled
animals (our most primitive) and are related to some of
the parasites that cause disease. These particular animals
are extinct and are known only from these rocks. From
their association with other shells they are known to have
lived in shallow salt-water seas, and by means of them the
geologist is able to recognize this particular limestone, even
when it has been taken from a well drilled many feet below
the ground surface, for these small shells are recognizable
even when the limestone has been broken into fine
fragments.</p>
<p>The limestone in which the caves of Florida Caverns
were carved is known from geologic studies made throughout
the state to have been raised from the sea by land
movements after being formed and to have been extensively
eroded, following which it was again submerged
under the sea and other limestones deposited over the
eroded surface. These limestones were subsequently raised
out of the sea to be eroded. Over this second eroded surface
a delta deposit of sand, clay and gravel was formed by
streams that emptied into the Gulf of Mexico.</p>
<p>The limestone that you will see in the caves is known
as the Ocala limestone, named from deposits near Ocala,
Florida. In the region about the Florida Caverns, limestones
named the Suwannee limestone and the Marianna limestone
overlie the Ocala limestone. These limestones were named
for deposits recognized along the Suwannee river and at
Marianna, Florida. The sand, clay and gravel overlying
all of these limestones are not named but are believed to
be the same age as deposits of the geologic period popularly
known as the &ldquo;ice age.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="img" id="fig5">
<img src="images/p04.jpg" alt="The &ldquo;duck&rdquo; results from irregular resistance of the limestone to solution by ground water. These nodular masses were more resistant and the less-resistant, usually softer limestone has been removed from about them, leaving the form resembling a duck. Several stalagmites are in the background. These are younger than the &ldquo;duck.&rdquo;" width="500" height="339" />

</div>
<p>Since emerging from the sea for the last time, this part
of Florida about the state park area has been undergoing
changes constantly. The rocks have been continuously
attacked by elements of the weather, and disintegrated
where exposed. Running streams carry away much of these
products of weathering, but the work of water under the
ground is the major factor in the creation of these caves
and the deposits in them. This underground water, running
through the pores in the limestone, has been and is now
wearing away portions of the land. These water channels
are isolated along fractures, bedding planes and other structural
weaknesses, or along poorly consolidated rock. The
water dissolves the limestone and carries it out into surface
streams and on to the sea, and as this material is carried
away the rock, through which the water flowed to the
surface, is being worn away an equal amount. The amount
of this material being carried away is illustrated at Silver
Springs, one of our larger springs, where each day about
450 tons of rock is carried away dissolved in water. When
it is realized that this is only one of thousands of springs
in Florida, you can readily see what a large amount of
rock is being dissolved from beneath the ground and just
how cavernous the rock must be.</p>

<h2 id="c2"><br /><span class="small"><span class="sc">Solution of Limestone</span></span></h2>
<p>The rocks in which the caves of the Florida
Caverns State Park were formed are limestone.
This rock is made of the mineral calcite, calcium
carbonate, and it is soluble in pure water
under conditions of favorable structure, a continuous supply
of moving water and time. However, in the water of
Florida this limestone is readily dissolved, because the
humid climate and prolific vegetation contribute organic
and mineral acids to water and make it a highly potent
solvent that is capable of dissolving large amounts of
this rock.</p>
<p>Limestone is as a rule jointed vertically and bedded horizontally.
Openings along these joints and beds provide easy
avenues of travel for water. The ultimate source of all of
Florida&rsquo;s ground water is from the rain and precipitates
from the air. As this rain water falls through the air it
becomes charged with carbon dioxide gas which combines
with water to form carbonic acid. On the ground humic
acids from rotting vegetation is added. These are the common
natural solvents of limestone. A good portion of this
acid charged water soaks into the ground, and as it descends
through lime rock small portions of the rock are dissolved.
However, relatively little solution occurs until sufficient
water enters the rock to fill completely all the available
pores. In this portion of the rock, saturated with water
and bathed with weak acids, solution is most active. Because
of the pressure of water entering the rock, ground water
tends to move horizontally along bedding planes which
offer the easiest exit. Thus, cave systems generally are
developed horizontally and one system may lie over another
and they may be connected by vertical tubes and rooms.</p>

<p class="bq">Weird vistas and eerie silhouettes meet the eyes of visitors who explore the amazing networks of trails in Florida Caverns. Droplets of mineral water, dripping through the ages, formed these underground caves into a natural, but highly artistic wonderland.</p>
</div>
<p>Any rain water entering the rock from the surface makes
its way downward to fill completely all the pores of the
rock at some depth. At it moves downward and then into
the saturated rock through pores and open spaces it acts
as a slow solvent to increase the size of the openings and
to connect them to form a continuous system of channels
through which streams filling the cavities may run.</p>
<p>As large caverns are formed, solution cavities of irregular
shape are gradually cut out and enlarged. Some of these
may be expanded to a point near the surface where surface
deposits (largely sand in Florida) will collapse into the
cavern and a sink is formed. The larger part of Florida&rsquo;s
natural lakes, sinks, depressions and ponds are the result
of solution of the underlying limestone. These features
range from small pits a few feet in diameter to large depressions
several miles broad. Many are perfectly round,
others are highly irregular. Some are cone-shaped with
rocky bottoms, some have broadly developed flat bottoms
and are known as prairies. Still others are vertical tubes,
only a few inches in diameter in some cases, that extend
as much as one hundred feet down into the limestones.
These are &ldquo;natural wells.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="box">
<p><i>Florida&rsquo;s State Parks include miles of white sand
beaches, fine streams, beautiful springs, excellent
fishing waters, floral displays, wooded ravines and
outstanding recreational areas. It is the Florida in
which the Indians hunted, fished and lived in original
surroundings of great natural charm and wildlife
profusion ... where yet remains the memory
and imprint of Spanish conquistadores, French crusaders
and Anglo-Saxon colonizers. Phenomena such
as disappearing rivers, vanishing lakes, historic
shrines, virgin country, strange subterranean landscapes
are all to be seen inside the parks.</i></p>

</div>
<h2 id="c3"><br /><span class="small"><span class="sc">Land Movements in Florida</span></span></h2>
<p>If these caves, we see in the Florida Caverns
Park area, were formed under water, how is
it possible to walk through them today? This
is an obvious question which requires an
answer. If rocks formed under marine waters are exposed
on the land surface today it is obvious that the land has
been raised out of the sea, or the sea has lowered. From
geologic evidence it is known that Florida has been rising
since late geologic time. This elevation is believed to be
caused by downwarping at the mouth of the Mississippi
River, where many thousands of box car loads of sediment
are dumped each day, accompanied by adjustments in the
earth&rsquo;s crust and the elevation of land areas surrounding
the delta of the Mississippi River.</p>
<p>Then there is a second cause by which these caves are
made dry. Everyone has heard that ice caps the North
and South poles of the earth, but few people realize that,
if all this ice melted, the level of the sea as it is known
today would be higher by about 110 feet. If all polar ice
melted, the Chipola River at Florida Caverns, would become
a salt bay, Marianna a seaport town, and a bay beach
would be located near the park area. However, do not
sell your present beach property too quickly since this
polar ice is known to be melting only a few inches a
century.</p>

</div>
<p>Considering the sub-tropical climate of Florida, isn&rsquo;t it
peculiar that ice had so much to do in shaping our land
surface? As a matter of record all of the surficial deposits
making up the large part of the land surface of Florida
were created and shaped during the geologic past (one to
ten million years ago) when ice piled up on the poles and
moved down over lower latitudes or when this ice was
being melted. In the United States as this ice piled up on
the North Pole and moved down over most of the middle
western states, the water forming this ice came from ocean
basins and the water in them was lowered as much as three
to four hundred feet. At this time much of the Gulf and
Atlantic bottoms was uncovered, land streams cut their
valleys much deeper, ground water circulated much more
vigorously and rocks through which it passed were dissolved
faster. Later as this ice was melted the lower parts
of stream valleys were filled with salt water and the streams
became sluggish and deposited sediment in their valleys to
make their flood-plains. Ground-water circulation was retarded
and the bottoms of the Gulf and Atlantic were
again covered. This uncovering of the bottoms of the Gulf
and Atlantic followed by covering constitutes a cycle. Five
of these cycles have been recognized in Florida, and the
red sands, clay and gravel that make up the surface of
most of Florida represent former bottoms of the Gulf and
Atlantic, now raised out of these seas by land movements.</p>
<p>Today we are living in a period following a time the
northern and southern extremes of the earth were covered
by ice, and this ice is still melting off of these areas.</p>

</div>
<h2 id="c4"><br /><span class="small"><span class="sc">Deposits in Cave</span></span></h2>
<p>We have seen then in the preceding discussion
how caves are formed largely in
rocks saturated with water, and how by
land movements and changes of sea level
the caves and pores formed in this rock are moved above
permanent water levels and exposed to air. It then becomes
possible to deposit rock in the pores and caves rather than
to increase their size by solution. As you go through the
caves you will notice that the walls are wet and that water
is oozing out of the pores of the rock.</p>
<p>This water has just passed through limestone and has
dissolved parts of the rock. The reader undoubtedly knows
that water will dissolve a substance in large quantities and
more rapidly if it is hot, and that it can hold more gases
to make stronger acids if it is under pressure. So, having
been released from a relatively warm rock in which it
was under some pressure and where there was little air
circulating, into a large cave where rapidly circulating air
cools the cave and evaporates the water, this water can
no longer hold all the limestone it has dissolved and it
releases part of it.</p>
<p>Small drops of water emerging from the lime rock on
cave walls are evaporated and calcite and other rock minerals
are deposited along these walls. Where these drops
cascade along the walls a continuous elongated ridge is
deposited. If the water oozes out in an extremely fine
coating of water, the entire ceiling, walls and floor may be
paved with calcite.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig11">
<img src="images/p11.jpg" alt="These deposits combine a rather even and general flow of water and possible intergrowth of the stalactites to make the thickened deposit. The ground water issued more rapidly and was concentrated at one point to make the long tubular deposits, the tube being made by rapid evaporation along the outer margins of the drops of water as they hang on the stalactite before the large part of the water falls to the floor." width="500" height="342" />

</div>
<p>Where individual drops collect on the cave ceilings, a
thin deposit may be formed on the ceiling after which the
remaining water may drop to the cave floor where more
calcite is deposited. Continuous dripping results in paired
deposits extending down from the ceiling and up from the
floor. The deposit on the floor is commonly thicker and
more columnar, whereas that on the ceiling is thin and
tapering much like an icicle. Those hanging from the
ceiling are called <i>stalactites</i> and those on the floor are
<i>stalagmites</i>. Where these two deposits are joined they are
known as a <i>column</i>.</p>
<p>These cave formations are all composed of the mineral
calcite, which forms all lime rock. If you will notice in
the cave this mineral is crystalline, and it is remarkable that
as calcite crystallizes from the many individual drops of
water it is arranged always in a particular pattern. These
crystal faces reflect light and form the many unusual and
beautiful arrangements which you will see in a visit to
the caves.</p>
<h2 id="c5"><br /><span class="small"><span class="sc">Early History</span></span></h2>
<p>Since early time, Florida Caverns have had
interest. They were first mentioned in writings
by Friar Barreda, who was with the first
overland expedition made by the Spaniards
to Pensacola Bay. The following paragraph is in the Friar&rsquo;s
own words, written 256 years ago:</p>
<p>&ldquo;On June 12 (1693) we continued northwest and after
we had journeyed a little more than three leagues ... we
reached an abandoned village of the Choctaw tribe called
San Nicholas where I came to preach the holy gospel in
the year 1674. Here we spent the night in the hollow of
such a beautiful and unusual rock that I can state positively
that more than 200 men could be lodged most comfortably
in it. Inside, there is a brook which gushes from the living
rock.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="img" id="fig12">

Visitors like to make a game of finding formations in the cave that resemble animals and other things.

</div>
<p>Experts, who know how to read stories told in the designs
on Indian pottery, state that the caves were known
to the Indians of this section long before the coming of
the Spaniards. There is considerable evidence that Indians,
even prior to 1693, had been in the habit of using Florida
Caverns and caves in the vicinity for shelter during their
hunting trips into the region and for refuge from their
enemies. In some of the smaller and dry caves there have
been found potsherds, or small broken pieces of Indian pottery.
According to the archaeologist, all of the sherds so far
discovered are of a late post-Columbian type. Ashes from
fires, dead for many years, flint arrowheads, and animal
bones have also been found.</p>
<p>Several times in history, Florida Caverns&mdash;a nature-made
shelter&mdash;was used as a refuge from armed forces. During
Andrew Jackson&rsquo;s punitive expedition against the Indians
in 1818, a large band of Indians escaped from his soldiers
by concealing themselves within the underground caves.
Again, during the War Between the States, an outfit of
Union soldiers en route to Pensacola was resisted by a home
guard unit from Marianna, composed of men too young
or too old to fight in the armies of the Confederacy. While
the battle was raging, women, children and slaves took
refuge in Florida Caverns.</p>

<p>A clear spring, which in reality is a subterranean river,
rising out of the lime rock, sends its lovely azure stream
down through the park over a mile before it enters the
Chipola River. The Chipola Natural Bridge, located in the
park, is a fourth-mile long and has been restored to its
original interesting geological condition with the removal
of logs and lumber which had jammed into it in bygone
days when the river was used to float them down to a mill.</p>
<p>Open the year round, Florida Caverns State Park is
comparable in interest to Carlsbad Caverns, N. M., Mammoth
Caves, Ky., and Luray Caverns, Va.</p>
<p>In addition to its geological attractions, the area in which
Florida Caverns is located is of peculiar interest biologically.
In it are found many species of both plants and animals
that are not expected so far south, as well as a large number
of typically southern forms.</p>
<p>The State Park system of Florida has been developed
as a coordinated group of Parks, each one of which stands
upon its own merits and each one possessing as many as
possible of the following values: Outstanding historic,
scenic and scientific attractions. Florida Caverns is richly
endowed with them all.</p>
<p>I hope that you have found this discussion of the creation
of lime rock, the formation of caves under water, the
elevation of these caves above permanent water levels and
the subsequent deposition in them, of interest.... We of
the Florida Geological Survey and Florida Park Service
hope that you enjoy your visit to the Florida Caverns
State Park.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
  www.gutenberg.org/license.


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with

Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
